# CastleDynamicProxy_Study

## Introduction
	
Dynamic proxy is not supported in C#. Fortunately we can use [CastleDynamicProxy](https://github.com/castleproject/Core).  
But there are extremely few documents provided by developers.   
KRZYSZTOF KOÅ¹MIC give us some examples how to using the Dynamic proxy. 
I read the [posts](https://kozmic.net/dynamic-proxy-tutorial/) one by one to learn how to use dynamic proxy.
But they all are posted long long ago, so we can not reach the code examples. I create the projects to reproduction the post examples.
